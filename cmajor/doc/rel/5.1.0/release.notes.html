<h1>Cmajor 5.1.0 for Windows x64</h1>

<h2>Release notes</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Bug fix: alignment bug in the assembly code generator of the MASM and CM/MASM backend fixed.</p></li>
<li><p>Bug fix: single-threaded build bug fixed.</p></li>
<li><p>LLVM updated to version 19.1.7.
The 5.0.0 version of the Cmajor compiler did not compile with the recent version of LLVM. </p></li>
<li><p>Added support to Windows GUI applications to CM/MASM compiler.</p></li>
<li><p>One new backend and one new compiler: <a href="https://slaakko.github.io/cmajor/tools/sbincmc/sbincmc.html">sbincmc</a>.
The problem with the MASM and CM/MASM backends introduced in version 5.0.0 is that they generate a lot of redundant code.
Each class template, function template and inline function generate identical code in each compile unit that uses it.
The linker is not able to remove the duplicates because the functions are instantiated using a unique name to prevent the linker from 
complaining about multiply defined symbols. The SBIN backend solves this problem by using its own <strong>sbinasm</strong> assembler that
is able to generate COMDAT symbols into object files. Each COMDAT symbol is associated with a set of functions with the 
same name. This COMDAT mechanism enables linker to remove replicated code. The name <strong>sbin</strong> comes from 'smaller binaries'. 
The <strong>sbincmc</strong> compiler generates somewhat smaller executables than the <strong>masmcmc</strong> and <strong>cmcmc</strong> compilers.</p></li>
